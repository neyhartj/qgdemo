# qgdemo

## Author

[Jeff Neyhart](neyhartj.github.io)

## Description

A shiny web-app to illustrate the introductory concepts in quantitative genetics. This app was first designed for the HORT/AGRO 4401 course at the University of Minnesota, however it may be widely applicable.

## Setup

Use the `shiny` R package to run the app:

```
library(shiny)

runGitHub("neyhartj/qgdemo")

```

Alternatively, the app may be accessed [online](https://neyhartj.shinyapps.io/qgdemo/) through the ShinyApps server.

## Teaching Material

I have written a lab worksheet to accompany the shiny app. You may access the PDF [here](https://github.com/neyhartj/qgdemo/raw/master/teaching_materials/qgdemo_problem_set.pdf) and a copy of the intendend answer key [here](https://github.com/neyhartj/qgdemo/raw/master/teaching_materials/qgdemo_problem_set_answers.pdf).
